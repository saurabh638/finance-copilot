## Current focus

M4 (M4a accounts CRUD, M4b interest rates) is built and on `main`. The milestone was split into
M4a and M4b during plan review because the account model, the CRUD endpoints and their tests
already exceeded one reviewable step, and the rate history needed its own tests.
**M5 (accounts screen and real account setup) is next, and needs its plan approved before any code.**

## Open questions

- Error body shape: CODING_STANDARDS.md section 3.4 asks for a consistent error body with a
  `code` and a `message`, but the API still returns FastAPI's `{"detail": ...}` on the auth and
  account routes. Proposed as its own small change.
- `PATCH /api/v1/accounts/{id}` ignores unknown fields, so `{"type": "cash"}` returns 200 and
  changes nothing. Proposed: reject unknown fields with 422 instead of ignoring them.
- The account routes do not declare their 404/400 responses, so `/docs` lists only 401/422 for
  them; the rate routes declare theirs. Documentation-only follow-up.
